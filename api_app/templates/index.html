      Introduction
    </h3>
    <p>
      First and foremost, this API was created heavily based on the Star Wars API. If you've never visited <a href="http://swapi.co" target="_blank">swapi</a> then I highly encourage you to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
    During the week after instruction finished at the <a href="https://theironyard.com" target="_blank">Iron Yard</a> in Greenville, SC and with time before final projects began, I decided to build this API. I have been a life-long Bond fan
       and there are many others like me. It was disappointing to me in my, albeit brief Google search, that I couldn't find an existing API for James Bond information. I hope that this API may be of use to someone,
       and I'll continue to try and make it better. This project is fully open source and built on top of
       python and Django REST framework. Anyone who would like to contribute is completely welcome. You can find the repository <a href="https://github.com/Cuddlemuffin007/james_bond_api" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <p>
      All information in the database can be accessed using the root api url <span class="well well-sm">/api/</span> and appending the plural name of the resource, i.e.
      <pre>/api/characters/</pre>
      This will return a paginated list of all characters, default page size is 10 records.<br>
      Resources that may be queried are:
      <ul>
        <li><pre>/api/characters/</pre></li>
        <li><pre>/api/movies/</pre></li>
        <li><pre>/api/gadgets/</pre></li>
        <li><pre>/api/vehicles/</pre></li>
        <li><pre>/api/bond-actors/</pre></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      You may also filter down the characters by the role they play in the movies by replacing <span class="well well-sm">/characters/</span> with a more specific resource name.<br>
      Accepted resource names are:
      <ul>
        <li><pre>/allies/</pre></li>
        <li><pre>/villains/</pre></li>
        <li><pre>/henchmen/</pre></li>
        <li><pre>/bond-girls/</pre></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Appending a query string <span class="well well-sm">?page=2</span> will return page two of the results.
      Thus, the following url returns page 3 of the vehicles used in Bond films.
      <pre>/api/vehicles/?page=3</pre>
    </p>
      Finally, you may also retrieve specific records by appending the id of the record to any specific endpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
    For example, using this format <span class="well well-sm">/api/&lt;resource-name&gt;/:id/</span> the following url
    </p>
    <pre>/api/characters/1/</pre>
      will return
      <pre>
      {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "James Bond",
          "bio": "Intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond is also known by his code number, 007, and is a Royal Naval Reserve Commander",
          "alias": "007",
          "ally": false,
          "villain": false,
          "henchman": false,
          "bond_girl": false
      }
      </pre>
      the man himself: Bond, James Bond.

      My name is Brennon Rogers and I am a Python and Django web developer. I also enjoy writing Ruby and have done a couple of simple Rails apps, too.
      Recently, I have begun to study Golang as well seeing as how it's getting pretty popular with a lot of startups and open source developers.

    <p>
      Outside of programming, I enjoy movies, TV, sports, and occasionally going for a run.
